# The Two Types of Developers

There are only two types of developers in this world...

1. **Those who _plan_ first.**
2. **Those who _build_ first.**

## My Approach

I am definitely the latter. I believe that building first provides the most leverage and long-term success. This doesn't mean that there shouldn't be structure or intermittent planning, but long-term planning can be the death of developers.

> **"Often times people think they need the perfect idea or perfect plan or perfect mvp but in reality they need to start actually doing real work, actually putting your product in users hands, actually pitching to vc's."**

### Key Actions:
- **Put your product in users' hands.**
- **Start doing and not saying**

## Proof of Concept

I develop first. Here is a screenshot of my 1-day +/- diff from my [VoxAI GitHub repo](https://github.com/aidanandrews22/VoxAI):

And to prove it was all in one day:

![3,000 line + 2,000 - and last push date](https://aidanandrews22.github.io/content/images/misc030425/3000linediffpush.png)

### Conclusion

Start building, iterate quickly, and adapt based on real-world feedback. This approach leads to tangible results and success.
