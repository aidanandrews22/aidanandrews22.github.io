# Why We Need Different Loss Functions for ML Models

Recently I got grilled in an interview about loss functions for simple ML models so here we are...

I am going to explain why we need different loss functions for ML models. Not any **new** or **novel** info in this post.

## Classification

- **SVM**: Support Vector Machines use hinge loss. It's all about maximizing the margin between classes. This approach focuses on finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes with the largest possible margin. The hinge loss penalizes misclassified points and those within the margin, pushing the decision boundary to be as far away from the nearest data points of any class as possible.

- **Logistic**: Logistic regression uses log loss (or cross-entropy loss). It's great for binary classification because it models the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class. The log loss function penalizes incorrect classifications with a cost that grows logarithmically, which helps in handling cases where the model is overconfident in its incorrect predictions.

- **Binary**: Binary classification often uses binary cross-entropy. It's similar to logistic but tailored for two classes. This loss function measures the dissimilarity between the true labels and the predicted probabilities, making it effective for tasks where the output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

- **Perceptron**: The perceptron algorithm uses a simple loss function based on misclassification. Unlike the others, it doesn't provide a probability output but rather a binary decision. The perceptron loss function updates the model only when a misclassification occurs, which can be efficient but less informative for complex datasets.

### Why Different Loss Functions?

Each classification loss function is designed to tackle the problem from a unique angle:

- **Margin Maximization (SVM)**: Focuses on creating a robust decision boundary that generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Probability Estimation (Logistic/Binary)**: Provides a probabilistic framework that is useful for understanding the confidence of predictions.
- **Simple Decision Making (Perceptron)**: Offers a straightforward approach for linearly separable data but lacks the nuance of probability-based methods.

These differences allow each loss function to be more effective in certain scenarios, depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the task.

## Neural Nets

Neural networks are a bit more complex. They often use mean squared error for regression tasks and cross-entropy for classification tasks. The choice of loss function can significantly impact the training process and final model performance.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used for regression tasks. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

- **Cross-Entropy**: Used for classification tasks. It measures the difference between two probability distributions.

## Transformers

Transformers are the new kids on the block. They use a variety of loss functions depending on the task.

- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: Often uses cross-entropy loss to predict masked tokens.

- **Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks**: Use cross-entropy loss for tasks like translation or summarization. This example uses s2s and attention.

### Conclusion

Different tasks require different loss functions to optimize model performance. Understanding these can make or break your model's success.
