# The Future of Development: Beyond Code

> **TLDR**: I envision a world where developers will write 0 lines of code. The paradigm shift will be from programming to engineering. You will still need to be a strong capable engineer, but you will not have to write code.

## The "Vibe Coding" Phenomenon

So let's discuss the elephant in the room, "vibe coding" has put the internet in a chokehold.

### What is "Vibe Coding"?

> Vibe coding is an AI-dependent programming technique where a person describes a problem in a few sentences as a prompt to a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding. The LLM generates software, shifting the programmer's role from manual coding to guiding, testing, and refining the AI-generated source code.

At face value it seems we have come to some paradigm shift in programming where users need no competency in CS or programming to achieve results. However, I think this is wildly naive. I want to preface by saying I am the antithesis of an AI doomer but yet I am not on a nonsensical hype train either.

## The Current Limitations of LLMs

Currently tools like Cursor, Windsurf or Bolt provide entry points for non-technical people to get into development. The limitations of these agents is not inherent to them. **The limitations arise entirely because of user incompetency.**

You will find the LLM unable to solve bugs that would be trivial for an experienced dev, or that your code has an incredible amount of security vulnerabilities, or the LLM is stuck in a loop of using deprecated code. These problems would all not arise if the person prompting and coding alongside the LLM knew how to code.

## The Future is No-Code Development

As a current researcher and experienced developer I can say wholeheartedly that the future involves the elimination of the need to learn how to code. When I say code I mean strictly programming: syntax, language, and literal code writing.

I believe developers should be language agnostic and only have to write pseudo code. I mean think about technical interviews—they typically have you write pseudo code and explain your thought process because they realize those are the qualities that make a real engineer, not whether you have memorized the documentation for a framework, library, or language.

## How I Use These Tools

I do absolutely all of my code writing in Vim or Cursor (with the occasional quick Nano edit). I have not hit any of the barriers or limitations that I just discussed. Alongside an LLM I am capable of coding absolutely anything in the world. In total I would say that LLM tools give me about **50x more breadth** and **3x code writing speed**.

### My Workflow Time Splits

- **75%** either completely solving the problem or solving most of it
- **10%** setting up file structure, initializing DBs/frameworks, or writing pseudo code
- **15%** road mapping and prompting

Road mapping and prompting is the most overlooked and highest ROI step. Granted that it implicitly requires step 1 to be complete. But if you can understand how the problem should be solved and what information is required to solve it, then you will see huge returns.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
