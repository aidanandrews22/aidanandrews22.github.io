## Overview
In this update, I have integrated the user ID into the chatbot instance constructor, leveraged user data tags for semantic search, and implemented mechanisms to update user data based on chat history. Below are the detailed steps and outcomes.

## Explanation
- **Initialization**:
  - Added `user_id` as a parameter to the `ChatbotService` class constructor.
  - !Important: Ensure frontend updates to populate `user_id`.

- **Wave 1 Semantic Search**:
I still run the RAG in waves but now wave 1 relies only on the user data instead of the query (it will fall back on the query if the user goal is not found in the dataset). So after wave 1 of RAG we will have all relevant journeys for the user. Then with wave two we can get journeys with explicitly relevant steps.

Top Changes:
  - Utilized user data tags for dataset traversal.
  - Queried user metadata for relevant journeys.
  - Implemented a fallback mechanism for queries with empty `user_goal`.

- **User Data Update**:
I wrote a script that scans the chat history of the user and sends it to chatGPT api. The response from the api call is the changes that are necessary for the users.csv file then the changes are writen.
Top Changes:
  - Organized user conversations in a JSON file by `user_id`.
  - Integrated new conversations into metadata if `user_id` exists.

## Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Adding `user_id` to Chatbot Instance Constructor

**File: `services.py`**

```python
class ChatbotService:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, user_id):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(ChatbotService, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.initialize(user_id)
        return cls._instance

    def initialize(self, user_id):
        ...
        self.user_id = user_id
        df = pd.read_csv("data/users.csv")
        self.user_data = df.loc[df["UserID"] == self.user_id]
        self.user_goal = self.get_user_info()
        ...

### Step 2: Semantic Search using User Data Tags

**File: `services.py`**

```python
def get_relevant_journeys(self, query):
    if self.user_goal:
        a_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(self.user_goal, convert_to_tensor=True)
    else:
        a_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query, convert_to_tensor=True)

    cos_score = util.cos_sim(a=a_embedding, b=self.titles_embeddings)[0]
    top = min(5, len(cos_score))
    top_results = torch.topk(cos_score, k=top)
    top_titles = [self.titles[idx.item()] for idx in top_results.indices]

    return top_titles, top_results, a_embedding
```

### Step 3: User Data Update Based on Chat History

**File: `data_update.py`**

```python
class UserDataUpdater:
    def update_user_data(self):
        updated = False
        for _, user_row in self.users_df.iterrows():
            user_id = str(user_row["UserID"])
            if user_id not in self.chat_histories:
                print(f"No chat history found for user {user_id}")
                continue

            chat_history = self.chat_histories[user_id]
            changes = self.process_chat_history(user_id, chat_history, user_row)

            if changes:
                for key, value in changes.items():
                    if value is not None:
                        self.users_df.loc[self.users_df["UserID"] == int(user_id), key] = str(value)
                updated = True

        return updated
```

## Examples

### Output from wave 1 RAG with user_goal:

```plaintext
User goal: Software Engineer at Apple
top_titles: ['Software Engineer at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Apple', 'Machine Learning Engineer at Apple', 'Marketing Manager at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Microsoft']
```

### Example User Conversation

**Immediately Upon Log In (no RAG sent to LLM, only user data)**

```plaintext
User: Hello
LLM: Hi Joe, it's great to see you back! How's your Python journey going so far? Anything in particular you're finding challenging or exciting?
```

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Keeping track of user data and integrating it with real-time conversations.
  - **Solution**: Utilized a structured JSON file to store chat histories and implemented a robust data update mechanism.

- **Challenge**: Ensuring the chatbot provides relevant and personalized advice based on user data.
  - **Solution**: Enhanced semantic search capabilities using user tags and metadata queries.

## Arbitrary Todo-List
- [ ] Tell front end to populate userID for each chatbot instance
- [ ] Add a scheduler that runs the data updater (keyword, and time)
- [ ] Expand dataset with more diverse user profiles and goals.
