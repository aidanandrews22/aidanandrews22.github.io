So lets discuss the elephant in the room, "vibe coding" has put the internet in a chokehold.

lets start by discussing what the term "vibe coding" even means
definition:
quote block: Vibe coding is an AI-dependent programming technique where a person describes a problem in a few sentences as a prompt to a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding. The LLM generates software, shifting the programmerâ€™s role from manual coding to guiding, testing, and refining the AI-generated source code.

at face value it seems we have come to some paradigm shift in programming where users need no competancy in cs or programming to achieve results.
however i think this is wildly naive.
i want to preface saying i am the antithesis of an ai doomer but yet i am not on a nonsensical hype train either
