So lets discuss the elephant in the room, "vibe coding" has put the internet in a chokehold.

lets start by discussing what the term "vibe coding" even means
definition:
quote block: Vibe coding is an AI-dependent programming technique where a person describes a problem in a few sentences as a prompt to a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding. The LLM generates software, shifting the programmerâ€™s role from manual coding to guiding, testing, and refining the AI-generated source code.

at face value it seems we have come to some paradigm shift in programming where users need no competancy in cs or programming to achieve results.
however i think this is wildly naive.
i want to preface saying i am the antithesis of an ai doomer but yet i am not on a nonsensical hype train either

## the current limitations of llms
currently tools like cursor, windsurf or bolt provide entry points for non technical people to get into development
the limitations of these agents is not inherent to them.
the limitations arise entirely because of user incompetency.
you will find the llm unable to solve bugs that would be trivial for an experienced dev
or that your code has an incredible amount of security vulnerabilities or the llm is stuck in a loop of using deprecated code
these problems would all not arise if the person prompting and coding alongside the llm knew how to code


## the future is no code development
as a current researcher and experienced developer i can say wholeheartedly that the future involves the elimination of the need to learnhow to code.
when i say code i mean strictly programming: syntax, language, and literal code writing
i believe developers should be language agnostic and only have to write pseudo code.
i mean think about technical interviews they typically have you write pseudo code and explain your thought process. because they realize those are the qualities that make a real engineer. not whether you have memorized the codumentation for a framework, library, or language.

## how i use these tools
i do absolutely all of my code writing in vim or cursor (with the occasional quick nano edit). i have not hit any of the bariers or limitations that i just discussed.
alognside an llm i am capable of coding absolutely anything in the world. in total i would say that llm tools give me about 50x more breadth and 3x code writing speed.

my workflow and time splits aee as follows:
chart: 75% either completely solving the problem or solving most of it; 10% setting up file structure, initializing frameworks, or writing psuedo code; 15% rode mapping and prompting
