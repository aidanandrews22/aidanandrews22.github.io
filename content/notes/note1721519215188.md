# Intent Classification

# Intent Classification Overview

Modern intent classification methods capitalize on large datasets and compute power. However, I have essentially no data- all data is synthetically generated- and one GPU. So I have to be a little creative when implementing intent classification. I started out using Bert-Uncased and trying to train a standard model, but as everyone in ML knows standard models accuracy is directly proportional to data size and quality. Given that I need the model to be fast and accurate on sub-par data, I went for a less complicated method.



## Grouping Intents to increase accuracy
Need RAG algorithms for journeys, 

**intents:**
1. General question (none)
2. Goodbye (none)
3. Journey exploration (j-set, user-info)
4. Feedback and reflection (user-info)
5. Goal setting (none)
6. Question (j-set, user-info)
7. Greeting (none)
8. Clarification (immediate chat history)
9. Resource recommendation (j-set, user-info)
10. App (app structure and info)
11. Progress tracking (j-set, user-info)
12. Answering (user-info)

**Datasets:**
1. J-set
2. User info
3. Immediate chat history
4. App structure and info

## Arbitrary Todo-List

- [x] Change the base prompts: there are instances where the context is not relevant to the query. 
- [x] Tell the model that the context sometimes will not be applicable to answer the query. 
- [x] Focus on query answering. Responses are too un-engaging. 
- [x] Also explicitly state that the journey is not about that user.
