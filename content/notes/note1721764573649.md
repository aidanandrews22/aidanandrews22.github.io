# Implementing User Tags for Wavular RAG

add user id as a parameter to the chatbot instance constructor (easy)
- remember to tell frontend to populate it

use the user data tags to traverse dataset for wave 1 semantic search. then use query on their respective metadata. (medium)

later, update user data when query prompts it (hard)

User goal: Software Engineer at Apple, top_titles: ['Software Engineer at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Apple', 'Machine Learning Engineer at Apple', 'Marketing Manager at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Microsoft']
