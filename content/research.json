    "description": "Deployed NVIDIA GR00T N1.5 on the Unitree G1 humanoid for language-conditioned manipulation in Isaac Sim. Key finding: LoRA fine-tuning on just 14 VR-teleoperated trajectories achieves generalization, while full fine-tuning catastrophically overfits. Pipeline includes Meta Quest 3 teleoperation, ROS2 integration, and lower-body stabilization for upper-body manipulation.",

Collected 20 physical teleoperation trajectories, fine-tuned GR00T, and deployed to hardware—confirming data compatibility is the critical factor. Includes custom ROS2 bridges and servo configuration fixes for Feetech STS3215 motors.",
