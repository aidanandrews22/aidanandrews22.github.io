Woke up from a a few rather interesting dreams. I can't remember which was the first and which was the second. One of them I completely do not remember at all. However for the one I did the content of the dream itself was rather inconsequential. It was about my old lizard that I had, it a long with a large amount of crickets escaped its cage and where in my room. The main thing that has stuck with me though is in both cases- and increasingly in recent times- I end the dream thinking to myself "thank the lord this is merely a dream" with the notion that I can just wake up and restart. This is fascinating because it could be analogous to something in my life (that of which I have no insight on). Although idealistic, I much oppose having the option to restart in the real world. I feel as if it discounts a lot of the meaningfulness of life. There's inherent beauty in life's perplexity.

\medskip\noindent
Didn't get the 5090 which was fairly disappointing as I woke up early to manually purchase it exactly at release time and wrote a bot to purchase it the second it released. However; maybe it was meant to be, I saved a considerable amount of money and have been researching (possibly superior) alternatives.

\medskip\noindent
I have continued to read meditations and got free chick fil a at an event hosted by JP Morgan. I did not interact with anyone in any meaningful way.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Arguably one of the best experiences of my life occurred today.} Even with my distain and indifference for birthdays and their superficial hedonist nature, it was solely due to the fact that it was my birthday that I had such a favorable experience. I received a plethora of messages in many different forms wishing me a happy birthday and expressing thankfulness or hope for my future. These messages were beautifully crafted and made me realize something very fundamentally important about life and human nature.

\begin{quote}
"Happy birthday Aidan! I hope you had a great day, you deserve it bro. I'm glad I was blessed enough to get to meet you and get to know you over these last few years. You really are an inspiration and amazing person to be around. Keep grinding cause you're gonna change the world one day man. Hope you have another great year.

See you soon hopefully!"
\end{quote}

Whether it was AI generated, I have not checked, I do not care. For that message holds so much value to me and the efforts I put in everyday. I am so thankful for all the people I have met and truthfully wish the best for them. I will do everything in my power to make sure all their deeds and words are reciprocated. I will do everything in my power to make sure that I provide for them the most that I possibly can whether that is emotionally, fiscally, or what have you. I am ready as a human to give up all that I have and ever will be to provide good service to those around me. I feel like my true nature is to give all that I have for God, my family, and those around me.

I almost forgot that I sent \$50 to a person this morning. I realized afterwards that I never even contemplated their intentions or the purpose for the request. It wasn't till afterward till I even thought about anything and I realized that I cared about this person and that irrespective the request I was ready to fulfill. Afterwards, they sent me their apologies for not wishing me a happy birthday and started my birthday morning with a stale request. However, I had not considered such things till after they mentioned it to me. This I am rather pleased about, there is a lot that I don't yet have or that I am not yet, but to know that I at least have a seemingly sound subconscious is refreshing.

\medskip\noindent
I am also trying to become a more open person, and that is one of the reasons I started these notes.
