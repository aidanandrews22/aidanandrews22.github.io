# Implementing User Tags for Wavular RAG

- [x] add user id as a parameter to the chatbot instance constructor (easy)
- remember to tell frontend to populate it

- [x] use the user data tags to traverse dataset for wave 1 semantic search. then use query on their respective metadata. (medium)

- [x] fallback on query when user_goal is empty

later, update user data when query prompts it (hard)
step 1:
add all user conversations to a json file
- organization is key, organize based on user id
- if user id exists in dataset add conversation to metadata

User goal: Software Engineer at Apple, top_titles: ['Software Engineer at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Apple', 'Machine Learning Engineer at Apple', 'Marketing Manager at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Microsoft']

Intent: feedback and reflection
User goal: Software Engineer at Apple, top_titles: ['Software Engineer at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Apple', 'Machine Learning Engineer at Apple', 'Marketing Manager at Apple', 'Software Engineer at Microsoft']
